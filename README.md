##Machine Learning Reading Group - IIT Palakkad

The reading group will be  running weekly from May 06, 2019 several years within the
[Department of Computing](http://comp.mq.edu.au), [Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/) (although we've only set
up this github page in 2018).

In 2019, we'll be meeting on Monday afternoons 3.00-4.30pm in a new
location: 4 Research Park Drive (the BD building), room 221.  The room
is on your right as you come out of the lift on level 2, is bright
red, and has a sign saying "Jan Hext room".  As always, anyone is
welcome to come along.
We'll be meeting every
second week, with the alternate week slot being filled by the [Image
Analysis Reading Group](https://computing-mq.github.io/iarg/).  

All are
welcome to join us.

Contact [Mark Dras](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~madras/) if you'd
like to get more information or to join the mailing list.
